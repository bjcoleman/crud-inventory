Does the json library encode and decode unicode characters?

API Design Notes:
* Four end points:
  * search - search for products by keyword to obtain current inventory
  * reserve - reserve a specified amount of a specified product (may only
     reserve a partial quantity if inventory changes)
  * buy - purchase a reserved product
  * release - release some or all of a reserved product
* Need to track changes in product state (in inventory, held, or sold)
* If held, product inventory is not found via search
* There is a time limit for how long products are held
* Customers must reserve(hold) before buying
* If the customer reserves more quantity than available, all available is held
* For buy, a proof-of-purchase token is required
* Reserve, buy, and release all require a customer ID token
* All API calls require an app token
